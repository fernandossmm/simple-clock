### A simple clock

<div align="center">
	<p>Developed to display a non-intrusive clock on the blackboard during student's exams</p>
</div>

## Features
- It's a clock.
- Click on the bottom right corner button to fullscreen. Click again to go back.

## How to install and run
- Developed to contain everything in a single HTML file, just download it and double-click.

## Architecture overview
### One file to rule them all
To make it as simple to use as possible, everything is contained in a single file. Using HTML's capabilities of inline styles and scripts, the clock is both beautiful and functional without the need for a thousand libraries or complex installation.

The clock updates once every five seconds, but it doesn't show seconds in order to be less anxiety-inducing: it's made for exams, after all!.
